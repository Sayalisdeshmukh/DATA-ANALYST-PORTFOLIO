# Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain data with the goal of identifying key factors that influence delivery risks, predicting delivery outcomes, and optimizing supply chain efficiency. The analysis employs various techniques such as data preprocessing, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, clustering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and time-series analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and data transformations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Includes Chi-square and ANOVA tests to understand relationships between various features.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses logistic regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression to predict outcomes like delivery risk and shipping delays.
- **Clustering**: Applies KMeans clustering to segment customers based on purchasing and financial behaviors.
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**: Reduces the feature space for better visualization and cluster separation.
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Implements ARIMA for predicting future sales per customer based on historical data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
  - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and preprocessing.
  - **SciPy**: For statistical functions (Chi-square test, ANOVA).
  - **Statsmodels**: For time-series forecasting (ARIMA).

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

- **Sayali_SupplyChain.py**: This is the main script for the analysis. It includes data loading, preprocessing, statistical analysis, model training, and visualizations.
- **Sayali_Supply_Chain_Data_Analysis_Report_Python.docx**: A detailed report summarizing the findings, methodologies, and results of the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a supply chain dataset containing details such as shipping dates, sales per customer, benefits per order, shipping modes, and delivery risks. The data is stored in a CSV file and contains features that are critical to understanding the operations and performance of the supply chain.

### Key Features:
- **Sales per Customer**: The total sales value generated by each customer.
- **Benefit per Order**: The financial benefit associated with each order.
- **Shipping Mode**: The method used for delivering goods.
- **Shipping Delay**: The difference between the actual shipping time and the scheduled shipping time.
- **Late Delivery Risk**: A binary classification indicating whether a delivery was late or not.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Visualizations Generated

The analysis generates several visualizations to help understand the data and insights:

## Correlation Heatmap:  
Visualizes the relationships between key supply chain variables.
## Shipping Delay vs Late Delivery Risk:
A boxplot showing how shipping delays affect the risk of late deliveries.
## KMeans Clustering: 
Visualizes the customer segmentation based on sales and benefit metrics.
## PCA Projection: 
A reduced dimensionality representation of customer clusters.
## Confusion Matrix: 
For evaluating the logistic regression model's performance.
## Error Distribution:
A comparison of Ridge vs Lasso regression model errors.

## Statistical Tests and Models
## Chi-square Test:
A test to determine the relationship between categorical variables like category and late delivery risk.
## ANOVA Test:
Used to check whether there is a significant difference in shipping times across categories.
## Logistic Regression: 
For predicting the likelihood of late deliveries based on several input features. The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Ridge and Lasso Regression: 
These are used to predict the continuous variable Shipping Delay, with evaluation based on RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
## KMeans Clustering: 
Segments customers into clusters based on sales and benefit per order.
## ARIMA Forecasting:
Forecasts future sales per customer based on historical data.

## Code Explanation
Data Preprocessing
The data is first cleaned by:

Converting date columns to datetime format.
Filling missing values in categorical columns (like Order Zipcode) with the mode.
Filling missing values in numerical columns (like Days for Shipping) with the median value.
Creating a new feature, Shipping Delay, by calculating the difference between the actual shipping time and scheduled shipping time.


## Results and Insights
Shipping Delay was found to be the most important factor in predicting late deliveries. Strategies should focus on minimizing shipping delays.
Logistic Regression showed excellent accuracy in predicting late deliveries, with a high balance between precision and recall.
Ridge Regression outperformed Lasso Regression in predicting shipping delays, indicating that a simpler model with less feature selection may be better suited for this problem.
KMeans Clustering revealed distinct customer segments that can be targeted with specific marketing or operational strategies.
ARIMA Forecasting predicted a decrease in future sales per customer, suggesting a need to prepare for potential declines in demand.

## Recommendations
Focus on optimizing shipping processes to reduce delays, especially for high-risk shipping modes.
Use predictive models to proactively manage late deliveries and shipping delays.
Explore customer segments identified through clustering for tailored marketing and operational strategies.
