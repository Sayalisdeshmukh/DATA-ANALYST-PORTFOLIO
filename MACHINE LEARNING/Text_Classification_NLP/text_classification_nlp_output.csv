VOLUME I

CHAPTER I


Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home
and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings
of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world
with very little to distress or vex her.",1
"She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,
well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,
interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,
in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak
every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her
as could never find fault.",0
"He was a nervous man, easily depressed;
fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;
hating change of every kind.",0
"I wish you may
not catch cold.""",0
"What a pity it
is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!""",1
"""Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!""",0
"Between _them_ it was more the intimacy
of sisters.",0
"Not a speck on them.""",0
"""Well!",0
"Her father composed himself
to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit
and think of what she had lost.",0
"Matrimony, as the origin of change,
was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled
to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but
with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,
when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from
his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to
suppose that other people could feel differently from himself,
he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad
a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal
happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.",1
